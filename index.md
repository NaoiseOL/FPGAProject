The aim of this project is to adapt a FPGA VGA Driver to display a graphic onto a 640x480 display. 
This will all be done through Verilog and demonstarted on the Basys3 development boards.

## **Template VGA Design**
### **Project Set-Up**
We set up the project in Verilog based on code given to us by our lecturer. The board being used is a Basys3 development board which is a member of the artix-7 family, below you can see an image of what the initial set up of the project looks like.

### **Template Code**
We were given some Template code to get us started on the project. This code included design sources for VGA Sync and a colour cycle source we can use to determine the patter that is outputted onto our screen from out basys3 board.
